# Swaasthya

Swasthya is a self assesment app.
During these covid times, going to hospital for minor diseases can be pretty dangerous so we have made this self assesment app. This app can predict disease based on the symptoms the user has given to the app. It can also record the diseases as a medical record.(Not fully implemented due to 36 hour time limit) and other medical facilities.

## To see the app working kindly install swasthya.apk
The youtube video for the app is given here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03_RJbAsuLE
